<p class="lead">This overview text should be replaced with text relevant to the schema being documented.</p>
<p>This text is inserted during the build into the body of the index.html page. It is linked to on the menu from the overview navigation menu item and from the headtitle to the left of the menu.</p>
<p>You can use any html here but it would be safest and most consistant to stick with semantic HTML 5 styled with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap classes</a>.</p>
<p>This file (overview.html) is stored as a CLOB in the ddd_text table under the key 'html', 'overview'</p>
