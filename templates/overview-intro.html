<h1>Overview</h1>
<p class="lead">This overview text should be replaced with text relevant to the schema being documented.</p>
<p>This text is used in conjunction with the page.html template, replacing the {{{overview}}} variable during the build of the index.html page. It is linked to the overview navigation menu item and from the title to the left of the menu.</p>
<p>You can use any html here but it would be safest and most consistant to stick with semantic HTML 5 styled with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap classes</a>.</p>
<p>This file (overview.html) is stored as a CLOB in the ddd_text table under the key 'html', 'overview'</p>
